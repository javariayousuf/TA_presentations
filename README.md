### User Research, Jacob Lu
> TA Jacob Lu talked about user research, specifically how to conduct quality research, what types of user resarch you can conduct (persona, observational) and what the benefits and drawbacks of conducting user research are.

75% of IT projects fail; why?
  + Poor planning, failure to understand scope, jump in too quickly
  + Not being able to take critique, stopping when project is failing
  
Solution to fixing your project
  + Truly identify the problem (undesirable outcomes) that has consequences
  + Understand that everyone has problems unique to them - there is no average user
  + Conduct user research
  
How do you conduct user research?
  + Interviews
    + Don't have leading questions: *"Why is the product so bad?*
    + Don't have loaded questions: *"Have you stopped riding the bus?"* assumes the user rides the bus
    + Have themes when asking questions, ask questions about specific topics
    + Establish credibility
    + Record information: take notes or record audio
